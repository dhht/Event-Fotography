# Event-Fotography

This project is meant to provide a simple source code for a static website. The website is based on the idea of an Event-Photography service (which I will privately distribute) and therefore this website will be designed accordingly.

Generally, you are fully allowed to use this source code for whatever you want. You can modify a copy of this project for whatever you want.

All help regarding the development, optimization and maybe design of the website will be appreciated. Thanks for all and have fun using this code.
